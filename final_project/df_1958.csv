The epicenter was located on the northern coast of Cross Sound near Palma Bay.  Underwater cables were broken in Juneau, Skagway, and Wrangell.  A local submarine slump off Khantaak Island in Yakutat Bay caused <B>3 deaths</B> and wrecked a boat.  Lituya Bay, the site of repeated huge local tsunamis, experienced a massive landslide which generated a surge of water reaching 525 meters in height -- 400 feet higher than the Empire State Building.  2 boats were wrecked, and <B>2 deaths</B> resulted.  30 million cubic meters of soil and loose material were washed away, along with ten square km of forest.  Shellfish colonies, a cabin, and mining equipment were also destroyed by this massive surge.  Total property damage --primarily from the three lost boats -- exceeded $100,000 (Reference #239).
<P>The earthquake caused numerous rock avalanches and slides. In Disenchantment Bay, a ""chunk"" weighing several tons broke off from a glacier descending to the water; waves 6 m high arose on the surface of the bay. On Khantaak Island, the sea waves resulting from a coastal section submerging under water reached a height of 5-6 m. A collapse in the mouth of the Alsek River caused a wave 1-2 m high, which spread upriver. The water level in the lower reaches dropped approximately 1 m; several hours later, the dam was breached and the shores of the river were flooded. In Glacier Bay, rocks crashed down from the steep beaches, resulting in small waves no more than 1/2-1 m (2-3 feet) high. Similar waves were observed in Dixon Harbor several minutes after the earthquake. The most catastrophic events, unique in the history of strong earthquakes, occurred in Lituya Bay, which is the T-shaped bed of an ancient glacier that has been filled in with water. The distinctive feature of the bay is the strong tidal currents at the throat, reaching 12 knots in velocity. At the time of the earthquake, about 300 million square meters of rock collapsed into Gilbert Bay from the northeast shore. The water extruded from the bay by the collapsing mass, splashed up on the opposite shore, reaching a colossal height. The movement of the water was so fast, that it uprooted a whole forest in the flood zone and stripped the bark and branches from the trees. Besides this gigantic splash, the collapse of this huge mass gave rise to a wave, which crossed the entire Lituya Bay from Gilbert Bay to the sea with a velocity of 150-200 km/hr, that is, with the speed of gravity waves, and devastated the shores of Lituya Bay. The tectonic dislocations in the source of the earthquake, and possibly the wave emerging from Lituya Bay, gave rise to a small tsunami, which was registered on remote tide gauges (Reference #415).
<P>The main mass of the slide, as outlined on figure 16, is a prism of rock that is roughly triangular in cross section, with dimensions of 2,400 feet and 3,000 foot along tho slope, a maximum thickness of about 300 feet normal to the slope, and a center of gravity at about 2,000 foot altitude. From those dimensions and an assumed specific gravity of 2.7, the volume and weight of tho rock mass are, respectively, <B>40 million cubic yards and 90 million tons</B>. It is highly probable that this entire mass plunged into Gilbert Inlet as a unit at the time of the earthquake, although tho only known fact is that it fell between about noon on July 7 and about 10 .m on July 10.

In this paper we review the potential causes for this landslide based on an integrated study of eye witness testimony, swath bathymetry data and stability analyses. Results show that the Sokkelvik landslide was most likely triggered by intense rainfall and snowmelt, but that the main cause is associated to the load of an up to 7.5 m high embankment fill. This fill was placed at the shoreline for road construction 6 months before the landslide. Results presented herein show the importance of accounting for extreme rainfall events and groundwater flow when planning construction activity in sensitive near shore areas.

<P>1963, October 9. The landslide and flood at Vaiont Reservoir in northeast Italy is a famous engineering disaster caused by the failure to manage the effects of reservoir filling upon the stability of Monte Toc, just to the south. The disaster was unusual in that dam collapse did not trigger the ensuing flood. Rather, a catastrophic landslip from the slope of Monte Toc pushed ~1/5 of the water in the newly created reservoir overtop and around the dam. The 2.6x10<sup>8</sup> m<sup>3</sup> slide mass flung down 30 million cubic meters of water to flood the Piave Valley below. 
<P><blockquote><i>Reference #10992:</i></blockquote> 
<P>1963, October 9. The Vajont Landslide occurred at 10.39 pm in Italy, in the Dolomites of Friuli, on the borders of the Veneto Region and about 100 km north of Venice. A mass of approximately 270-300 million m<sup>3</sup> of rock and debris collapsed into the reservoir generating a wave that over-topped the 261.6 m high double curved arch dam built across a V-shaped gorge. The flood wave dropped into the Piave Valley destroying the town of Longarone and other villages nearby. <b>More than 2,000 people (the real number is not known) were killed</b>.
<P><blockquote><i>Reference #10993:</i></blockquote> 
<P>1963, October 9. At 22:39 a huge landslide of about 270 million m<sup>3</sup> slid from Mount Toc into the Vajont artificial reservoir, in north-eastern Italy. The amount of water in the basin at that moment was about 115 million m<sup>3</sup>. The resulting displacement of water caused the generation of an impulse wave that spread throughout the basin. Its impressive wave run-up on the north slope of the lake, in front of Mount Toc, reached and <b>damaged buildings located in Casso</b> about 235 m over the original height of the lake surface. The resulting wave rundown crashed into the front of the landslide and partially crossed over the slide bulk, reaching the depressions behind the slide. On the east side of the basin, a portion of the water which was pushed forward by the landslide formed a wave with smaller amplitude that travelled to the east, reaching the eastern most end of the reservoir in the mountains. 
<P>During the whole event several impulse waves crested the dam or moved onto the surrounding slopes which became a way for the water to move out into the narrow canyon that connects the dam to the Piave Valley. The mass of water that poured into the canyon, compressing the air, generated a wave of pressure that acted as a wind. This ""wind"", propagating at a speed greater than the waterfront, preceded the waterfront and produced the first damage in Longarone, before the water reached the town. The villages located along the Piave riverbed were completely devastated and turned into a flat plain of mud, with about 1700 casualties. The wave travelled upstream for about 5 km and in the downstream cross-sections of Ponte nelle Alpi and Belluno (located respectively at about 11 and 19 km from Longarone) the estimated maximum flow was 20% - 50% higher than the one observed during the famous 1966 flood wave.

The wave coincided with an unusually high tide. In Prince Rupert a high tide of 7.5 m occurred at 03:18 (LT). This was 0.52 m above the predicted tide, and only 0.34 m below the all time recorded extreme high tide.<P>At Wiah Point the wave, or waves, washed over a high water rock, and dislodged two big oil tanks which has been erected there about 30 cm above high water, and washed them onto the shore. The tidal wave that hit the remote west coast of the Queen Charlotte I., got 10.7 m, tore oil tanks from concrete bases and apparently took the life of a man. The tidal wave caused extensive damage at Weah Point near the village of Masset.<P>About 3.2 km north of Masset a number of logs were washed onto the road, which is there about 1.2 m above high water. At Tow Hill logs were moved that had been in the same position on the beach for a number of years. At the mouth of the Tlell River, where a tidal bore has been observed on occasion, noise as of a wave travelling up the river was heard during the night, and a small piece of arable land near the high water line was flooded and damaged.<P>No record of the tsunami wave is seen on the tide gauge records in Prince Rupert or in Tusu, on the west coast of the Queen Charlotte I. A check for a filed death certificate at the Dept. of Vital Statistics in Victoria reveals a man was indeed lost in the sea in the period March 28-30, 1963 but reported missing near Jedway, BC which is on the inside southern tip of Moresby I. just north of Cape St. James.<P>An interview with Mr. Edward Hartt of the Canadian Coast Guard at Seal Cove near Prince Rupert confirmed the early morning arrival of this approximately 5.5 m high wave (over the tide) at Langara Lighthouse where he was the lightkeeper at the time. The wave broke two large fuel tanks from their moorings at the lighthouse dock and deposited them ashore well above high water. Mr. Hartt felt the source of this large wave was probably from the southwest because of the areas where most the damage occurred around the lighthouse.<P>A disturbance was reported from Dixon Entrance region of the Queen Charlotte I. during the night of March 30-31.

The report of minor damage at Port Simpson by VonHake and Cloud was not confirmed in the interviews of Port Simpson residents by the author. It is unfortunate that the lightkeepers records from other lighthouses nearer to Port Simpson during this period (March 1963) are no longer available to confirm any closer sightings of this unusual wave to Port Simpson. According to Mr. Ed. Hartt these records were destroyed when the coast Guard moved their offices from Prince Rupert to Seal Cove in 1972...<P>Stephenson [2003] resumes the information on this event as follows:<br>-If there was a tsunami, it was a local event generated by an underwater slump.<br>-This tsunami event was almost certainly smaller than any of the ""reported"" heights. From the report by Willie Rapatz it follows that the dislodged tanks were only about 0.3 m above the high water (HW) line, and the road which logs washed up onto was only about 1.2 m above the HW line.<br>-The reported 10 and 12 m waves were probably heights above chart datum, meaning that the maximum wave height was about 5.5 m.<P>(above from reference #4153)<P>1963, March 30/31.

The edifice of Yate volcano, a dissected stratocone in the Andean Southern Volcanic Zone, has experienced multiple summit collapses throughout postglacial time restricted to sectors NE and SW of the summit. The largest such historic event occurred on 19th February 1965 when ~6.1x10<sup>6</sup> m<sup>3</sup> of rock and ice detached from 2,000-m elevation to the SW of the summit and transformed into a debris flow. In the upper part of the flow path, velocities are estimated to have reached 40 m s.1. After travelling 7,500 m and descending 1,490 m, the flow entered an intermontane lake, Lago Cabrera. A wavemaker
of estimated volume 9<u>+</u>3x10<sup>6</sup> m<sup>3</sup> generated a tsunami with an estimated amplitude of 25 m and a run-up of ~60 m at the west end of the lake where a settlement disappeared with the loss of 27 lives.

<P>A moderately violent phreatomagmatic explosive eruption of Taal Volcano, in the Philippines, occurred from 28 to 30 September 1965. The main phreatic explosions, which were preceded by ejection of basaltic spatter, opened a new crater 1.5 kilometers long and 0.3 kilometer wide on the southwest side of Volcano Island in Lake Taal. The eruption covered an area of about 60 square kilometers with a blanket of ash more than 25 centimeters thick and killed approximately 190 persons. ..
<P>The explosions within the crater area produced shock waves that generated water waves, which probably reached
maximum height between Volcano Island and the west shore of Lake Taal. These waves capsized some of the boats filled with the fleeing residents of the island and accounted for many of the fatalities. The maximum height of the waves is not known, because evidence of wave height during the early, most violent phase of the eruption is now covered by layers of ash. However, on the west shore of Lake Taal, directly west of the mouth of the explosion crater, there is clear evidence that waves reached 4.7 meters above lake
level and swept inshore as much as 80 meters. The debris left by these waves is on top of the air-fall ash, hence the waves must have occurred very late in the eruption. Undoubtedly much larger waves swept that coast earlier. 
<P>A streamflow gage 1.5 kilometers downstream from the outlet of Lake Taal shows an increase of flow from an average of 20,500 liters per second for several days before the eruption to a maximum of 28,400 liters per second on 28 September, followed by decreases to 23,800 liters per second
on 29 September, and 22,800 liters per second on 30 September. Such an increase is probably due to excessive
wave action and to seiches produced by the explosion shock waves, as well as to displacement of water by the ash fall and to the inordinately heavy rain that accompanied the eruption.

<P>May 16, 1968, 9:49 [local time]. A tsunami, which did not do great damage, was observed on the coast of Hokkaido Island and the Sanriku coast after the earthquake. The limited damage is partly explained by the fact that the tsunami coincided with the ebb tide phase. The protective works built after the Chilean tsunami of 1960 also played a large role. The waves had a height of 1-2 m on the south coast of Hokkaido Island, and 2-5 m in the regions of Tokachi and Hidaka. The tsunami also reached a height of 5 m in places on the Sanriku coast.
<P>The tsunami was observed by tide gauges in Japan and throughout the Pacific Basin in Mexico, Russia, the Marshall Islands, Alaska, California, and Hawaii. 
<P>As a result of the earthquake and tsunami, 52 people died and 329 people were injured; 676 homes were completely destroyed and 2,994 homes were half destroyed; 13 homes burned down and 529 homes were flooded; 97 ships were washed away and 30 were sunk. In addition, roads, bridges and protective dikes were destroyed. The total damage was estimated at least at 130 million dollars. 
<P>The mean displacement of the surface of the sea at the source has been estimated by Abe at +82 cm in the zone of elevations, and -20 cm in the the zone of subsidences. Aida estimated the maximal initial rise of water at 5 m, the drop at 2 m, and the energy of the tsunami at 4 X 10<sup>20</sup> ergs.

<P>1968, August 2, 4:20 [local time], 16.5 N, 122.2 E, depth 36 km, magnitude 7.7. There was a destructive earthquake with source off the east coast of Luzon Island. The earthquake caused a tsunami, which was registered by the tide gauges on the Ryukyu Islands and the Japanese Islands with a mean height of 10 <u>+</u> cm (and a maximal height of 30 cm off the capes on the south coast of Japan, which intensified the oscillations. 
<P>The records of the special automatic registers on the islands of Enoshima (Miyagi Prefecture) and Oshima (off the Izu Peninsula), barely show the tsunami. At Ishigaki and Naha (Ryukyu Islands), the height of the tsunami was under 15 cm. The envelope of the oscillations has a spindle shape. The front of the tsunami is traced with difficulty. The time of onset of the most intensive oscillations presumably corresponds to the approach of the marginal (shelf) waves (Hatori, 1969 c).

<P>On April 1, 1968 at 9:42 [local time] there was a strong magnitude 7.7 earthquake with a sub-latitudinal source 60 km long between Kyushu and and Shikoku Islands (32.6 N, 132.2 E, depth 40 km). 
<P>A tsunami of moderate intensity occurred. It reached the nearest coasts of the islands of Shikoku and Kyusllu approximately 20 minutes after the earthquake. On the average, the range of the oscillations in sea level on these coasts was 2-2.5 m. The greatest rise of water, 3 m
or somewhat more, was resgistered on Shikoku Island at 
Urashiri and Komame; here the water flooded across the protective dikes and caused destruction. At most points, however, the oscillations in level did not exceed the regular flood and ebb oscillations. The tsunami, on the basis of visual observations, began with a flood tide almost everywhere. The first or the second wave was the highest. As a rule, the water level rose quietly, and strong currents arose only in narrow straits. The mean period of oscillations was close to 20 minutes.
<P>The tsunami was registered clearly by the tide gauges on the southern coast of Japan. The tsunami begins with a flood tide on all the tide gauge records. However, on the records of the instruments set up on Shikoku Island, the height of the first trough is approximately twice as great as the height of the first crest. For this reason, it has been surmised that there were subsidences of the floor in the southern part of the source of the tsunami, while elevations of the floor predominated on the whole at the source. According to Hatori, the vertical displacements of the sea bottom at the source of the tsunami were about 20 cm, and the energy of the tsunami was 1.3 X 10<sup>20</sup> ergs. According to Aida, a comparatively uniform elevation of the bottom by 30-35 cm took place at the source, and the energy of the tsunami was (1.4-2.2) X 10<sup>19</sup> ergs. It is conjectured that the earthquake was a consequence of gently sloping overthrust in a west to east direction.

On October 17, 1974, in Kitimat Inlet, BC, a submarine slide generated a water wave of 2.8 m amplitude.[Murty, 1975; Murty and Brown, 19791].
<p>
Underwater slopes in fjords and inlets commonly attain a delicate equilibrium with the long-term ambient marine conditions associated with wave, current and tidal regimes, and the rate and character of sedimentation. This stability can be disrupted, leading to failure, by events or conditions that depart significantly from ambient conditions, Landslides, slumps and rock falls are often the secondary effects of earthquakes. [Rabinovich at al., 20031.
<p>
According to Johns et al., [ 19851, a slide event was believed to have taken place on October 17, 1974,
but its evidence was only circumstantial. A sea-surface wave reached approximately 2.4 m high, it was observed in the head of the inlet at 11:05 A.M. (LT), shortly after extreme low tide. The location of the seafloor sediment movement that might have caused this smaller wave was not determined. It is possible, however, that this event was related to the formation of a chute on the delta front/sidewall on the eastern side of the inlet. At this location, there was a chute that originated in a steeply sloping area at the intersection of the delta front, the inlet sidewall, and a distal part of a small fan delta near Kitimat Village.",0.0,653.4976472016634,Vancouver,2581079,-2.347

tide (6.02 m drawdown from high tide). On April 27, 1975, following a major slide, water waves with ranged up to 8.2 m were generated...
<P>The slump originated across a front approximately 1 km wide and travelled approximately 5 km down the inlet to a final water depth of 210 m. The main part of this path was over ~ 1/2 deg slopes. The associated water wave amplitude, possible as large as 8 m and water disturbance for about 1 hour was responsible for the destruction of boats, docks and other property.
<P>At the time of occurrence of the slide of April 27At the time of occurrence of the slide of April 27, 1975, there was no mujor seismic event reported in that area. Also, there was no meteorological event at that time which could have caused large water level oscillations. Hence, there is no doubt that the water waves were generated by the submarine slide. At least two water waves (and possibly three) were generated, and propagated into the connecting bays and channels, The largest wave was estimated to be 8.2 m in range (crest to through)... The whole water-level disturbance lasted about an hour. In Bish Creek and Clio Bay, which are about 8 km from the site of the slide, at least one wave was observed.

In Laucala Bay waters the amplitude, measured from crest to trough, may have been about 0.5 m (i.e. the order of half the tidal range) because sand banks appeared and disappeared and the change in level on the barrier reef was sufficient to have a noticeable effect on appearance of the ocean waves breaking on the reef edge, according to reliable observers at the MRD office which is about 2 km from Laucala Bay shoreline and 8 km from the reef bounding the seaward side of the bay (Fig. 3). Unfortunately the only available tide-gauge data in Suva are smoothed 15-minute mean plots and mean hourly values of the Suva Harbour sea level. These data 'effectively smooth out the tsunami waves and a tsunami in Suva Harbour could not be detected. The occurrence of the waves is of particular interest because earthquakes with such a small magnitude do not generally cause tsunamis (Iida, 1970). The tsunami was probably generated by a minor submarine slump caused by the shaking (intensity MM 4-5) in the Suva-Beqa outer reef zone in a manner similar to that of the 1953 tsunami (Everingham, 1983b), which illustrates .the ease with which a slump can be initiated. If slumping can be started by relatively low earthquake intensities even a minor shallow tremor in the southeastern Viti Levu seismic zone (Fig. 4) could start a submarine slump should the epicentre be close to a suitable source.

A catastrophic earthquake shook Sumbawa Island. It covered an extensive area from the southern coast of Indonesia to the northwestern coast of Australia. A large tsunami was produced. The first press reports announced waves 30 m high in Indonesia and 8 m high in Australia Apparently, these figures were exaggerated. A group from the International Tsunami Information Center
visited the coastal regions of Sumba, Sumbawa, Lombok and Bali Islands to assess the destruction and wave run-ups, and to obtain other detailed information from local people. Inaccessible areas on the southern coast of Sumba and
Sumbawa islands were photographed from the air. Information was processed that had been gathered by the Indonesian military, search and rescue parties, provincial administration, and by medical teams visiting accessible areas in the coastal villages to offer help and assess the extent of loss of property and life. These records were supplemented by radio broadcast accounts from individual
settlements. <P>The southern coasts of the islands, with the exception of Bali, is sparsely populated. Villages are generally small and scattered. Hence the loss of human life was not high. According to incomplete data, over 180 people were killed and 3,900 were left homeless. Fishing boats and equipment were lost. For a large part of the Indonesian territory, which had sustained heavy damage from the tsunami, no information is available on the height of the rise in the water level. However, in the accessible region of Sumbawa Island, preliminary information reported that the tsunami reached a height of at least 15 m above the
high-tide mark and inundated the island up to 500 m inland.
<P>According to eyewitness accounts, the tsunamis appeared on the Indonesian coast about an hour or two after high tide, beginning with an ebb, which soon left a 100-200 m wide drained belt. This was followed by three large waves with a period of about 5 min or less. The first wave was the
highest and most ferocious. Several witnesses noted the duration of agitation of the sea although most made no mention of it. An unusual phenomenon occurred during the time interval between the earthquake and the arrival of the tsunami. Residents of villages in the Sumbawa and Lombok Islands thrice heard a sound at intervals estimated from a few seconds to 1 min and more. It was diversely described as sounding like a bomb explosion or a sonic boom. The sound
reportedly emanated from the epicentral area. Nearly every village reported that the water became black and some reported a rise in temperature and an unpleasant smell. The tsunami reached a height of more than 10 m along the coast of Sumbawa.

Bedosti (ref #9286) hypotesises that a possible cause is a submarine landslide beneath the 200 m isobath more or less between Termoli and Vasto. Mosetti (anonymous)also suggests the occurrence of a submarine landslide in the Adriatic sea. 
The following information is taken from Bedosti (ref #9286).
The oscillations period was about 10-15 minutes.
At Giulianova the sea withdrew by about 50 m at 11h 59m am and it came back 6 min later surpassing the normal level by about 60 cm. Oscillations repeated many times with period of 15 min and amplitude of 60 cm in the harbour until 5h 30m pm.
At Ortona only one oscillation observed, starting at 11h 30m am with a withdrawal of 15 m. The water came back at 12h. 
At Bisceglie the sea withdrew by 2-3 m at 6h 30m and then it flooded the beach by  200 m. The maximum height was 50 cm. Two fishing boats broke their mooring.
At Molfetta at 5.00 am 10 m of withdrawal. The period was 5 min. 
Anomalous oscillations also observed at Fossacesia, Vasto, Termoli, Campomarino and Trani at different times. 

Some newspapers report detailed description of the phenomenon:
At Termoli the sea withdrew for tens of metres leaving the harbour dried and then violently came back; some swimmers referred that the sea water suddenly became cold and immediately after became also turbolent and strongly agitated (Anonymous).
At Bari the sea water suddenly witdrew many times leaving the seafloor dried; some moored ships in the harbour went aground and some fish was found on the beach (Anonymous). 
Parenzan (ref #9287) reports that at Bari and Vieste the sea suddenly withdrew for about 50-100 m leaving boats aground and after a few minutes the sea violently inundated the shore with very high waves, causing damage to the boats and some injured people. The sea water swept away the beach-umbrellas.
In many islands and places along the Yugoslavian coasts the sea water suddenly rose; at Vela Luka (Cursola island) the waves was 8 m high inundating the first floors of  all the buildings on the shore. Many ships suffered severe damage and the sea water flooded the cost for 650 m inland (Anonymous) 
Also at Dubrovnick, Caltaro and at the Iissa island anomalous waves were observed (Anonymous).

The settlements of Waiteba, located at the neck of the cape on the eastern side of the cape, and Labala-Mulang on the western side suffered the most. The tsunami started with the sea receding from the coast and then returned with tremendous force. Mainly villagers rather than fishermen suffered. <P>(above from reference 417)
<P>1979, July 18. Sources from the daily newspapers ""Kompas"" and ""Suara Karya"" of Indonesia stated that the tsunami waves that occurred on July 18, 1979 at approximately 1:00 A.M. (local time) in Indonesia swept up the coastal area 500 meters inland and over hills that were 10 meters high. The tsunami originated from an area which is at 8 deg 32 min S - 123 deg 30 min E, on the southern coast of Lembata Island.
The waves deposited 2 meters thick of sand on coastal settlements. A total of 187 persons were killed, most of them found buried under the sand, 32 persons were seriously injured, and 364 persons were missing. The 3 villages (Labala, Waiteba and Bobu), with population totalling 3,422, were completely obliterated. According to the Smithsonian Institution's SEAN Bulletin of July 31, 1979, the meteorology and geophysics station at Kupang recorded an earthquake of undetermined magnitude at 00:42 local time on 18 July, located in the Sawu Sea (south of Lomblen). Light rocks, dead fishes, and oil film were found floating on the coastal waters, days after the tsunami. The coastline shifted 20 meters inland. The sites where a school, a health centre and a government building were located, are now under the sea. (Reference #3330)
<P>1979, July 17 [18]. A tsunami generated by a landslide struck the south coast of Lomblen Island, Lesser Sunda Islands, Indonesia. The landslide, which occurred on the south coast of Lembata Island,was possibly triggered by a small earthquake in the Sawu Sea. Four villages on Lomblen were destroyed with 187 killed and 364 missing. (Reference #45)",0.0,592.4032058341538,Makassar,1583553,-0.521

Ligurian Sea, France. Waves of the tsunami type suddenly beat down on
French Riviera. The sea receded 300 m on the shore between the beach of La Salis to the south of Antibes and the vicinity of Nice, i.e. over a distance of 60 km, and then it returned with two crests 10 m high. Six people were killed and three were lost. Numerous coastal buildings were damaged, many cars were smashed, boats that had been moored were torn away and carried off to sea. Repeated oscillations of the sea level continued for over 4 hours along a 100 km stretch of coast. The waves were not preceded by an earthquake, but an embankment 300 m long, which had been erected in the delta of the River Var
on an underwater platform, disappeared into the sea in a matter of minutes practically at the same time as the waves. It was therefore assumed that the oscillations of the sea level were caused by a powerfid underwater landslide. The collapse of the embankment alone seemed to be insufficient to generate the splash of the water observed. The bathymetric survey conducted by the
hydrographic service and by other organisations of France revealed considerable depressions in the river bottom on the eastern edge of the underwater canyon of the River Le Paillon and on the western edge of the canyon of the River Var. A landslide of the vanished material of 400 million m<sup>3</sup> in volume could easily have caused the waves observed. The underwater telephone cables, belonging to Italy, from Genoa to the Balearic Islands and from Genoa to Sassari on the Island of Sardinia were torn at 17h45m and 22h, respectively, on October 16; the sites of gaps were located 80 km and 110 km to the south of Nice, respectively. The first cable was damaged along a distance of 80 km, the second along a distance of 30 km. The
cables from Cannes to L'le Rousse (the Island of Corsica) and from Barcelona to Pisa did not suffer. (reference #2130)
<P>A submarine slope failure occurred during the construction of the Nice new harbour. No seismic event recorded. Except one person in Antibes, the victims were working men on the building site. This gravitational submarine sliding generated a tsunami observed by several witnesses in the Baie des Anges. The maximum effects were observed 10 km from the building site near Antibes, that was inundated (one person killed). Wave heights of about 1 m observed. At La Salis (close to Antibes), witnesses reported a first wave of about 50 cm, 5 minutes after the landslide. This wave was followed by three 3 m high waves with a period of about 8 minutes. At the harbour of Saint Laurent du Var water went down (about 2 m) 1 minute after the landslide and then went up with an amplitude of 1 m.
The tide-gauge records of Nice and of Villefranche show that the first wave is a trough of about 10 cm.

The earthquake and tsunami associated with it were responsible for the destruction of at least six fishing villages and the death of hundreds of people in the Narino State of Colombia. At least 15 other coastal towns in the area were rocked by the earthquake and were damaged by the waves. Waves measuring anywhere from 2-5 meters destroyed many of these coastal villages. People along the coast, who survived the earthquake by running outside their homes, were carried away a few minutes later by the large tsunami waves generated by the earthquake. Six fishing boats, one with 40 men aboard, were lost. A pier on the prison island of Gorgona was destroyed, however, no injuries from either the earthquake or the tsunami were reported from there. Most of the houses at Charco, a village of 4,000 which were built on stilts over a lake were knocked into the water. Waves sent the Iscuande River out of its banks along the Pacific coast. The wall of water reportedly in the village of Iscuande caused extensive damages. At least one person was reported dead from that area.
<P>Hardest hit of all the coastal villages was the fishing village of San Juan, where the waves completely overran the island destroying just about everything in their path. Numerous deaths were reported from San Juan which was totally devastated and is in the process of being relocated further inland at the present time. According to eyewitness reports, 3 to 4 waves were observed, the first wave arriving approximately 10 minutes after the main earthquake. The water recessed first to about 3 meters below the level of the sea. The first wave arrived minutes later. The third wave was the largest, and at San Juan Island it was approximately 5 meters above the level of the tide, which fortunately, was at its lowest at that time.
<P>The maximum difference between low and high tide in the region for that time of the year was approximately 1.3 meters, thus, the maximum wave could have been that much more, if it had arrived at high tide, and numerous more deaths could have resulted. Considering that the mean elevation of the coastal islands is approximately 2 to 2.5 meters above high tide, it would mean that maximum waves would have completely overrun all of the coastal islands in the area. Approximately 30-35 km of the coast was hardest hit by the tsunami, while the length of the area hardest hit by the earthquake was approximately 225 km in length, from Guapi to Tumaco.
<P><B>It is estimated that the majority of casualties (at least 80%) were the result of the tsunami rather than of the earthquake. An ITIC estimate based on informal reports is that 500-600 people may have been killed by the combined effects of the earthquake and tsunami with about 4,000 people injured. Homes of at least 10,000 persons were destroyed.</B>
<P>(above from reference #3330)
<P>The tsunami caused great damage, and was similar in scope to the event of January 31, 1906. Ramirez and Goberna (1980) note that the wave arrived 3 minutes after the earthquake, at San Juan de la Costa. The only death toll from the tsunami is from Tumaco (36 deaths). There may have been other deaths from the tsunami, but they have been included with the earthquake counts by disaster agencies.

<P>The earthquake generated a tsunami that began striking the Japan coast approximately 12 minutes after the earthquake occurred. One hundred lives were lost as a consequence of the tsunami alone. The tsunami also caused significant flooding and property damage to coastal
regions. The tsunami affected the entire Japan Sea, hitting the surrounding coastline of the Korean Peninsula and the USSR. Three lives were lost in South Korea, when the wave arrived there approximately 1-1/2 hours after the earthquake... Clearly, most of the impact occurred north
of the Oga Peninsula, where a maximum run-up of 14.9 m was recorded... Significant wave run-up was also observed along the Korean coast... A maximum run-up of 3.2 m was followed by a run-down of -5.6 m [Port of Imweon]. Most of the impact of the tsunami in South Korea occurred between Imweon and Sogcho.. During the tsunami, 100 individuals were drowned, most of them at Noshiro, Hachimori, and the Oga Peninsula. These individuals were caught on the shoreline or on offshore construction sites. Tsunami
warnings were issued approximately 14 minutes after the earthquake occurred; however, the leading wave reached the shoreline at these locations at approximately the same time.
In Korea, three deaths were attributed to the tsunami. Since the tsunami reached the Korean shoreline approximately 1-1/2 hours after the earthquake occurred, these deaths could have been prevented... In Korea, over 70 ships were damaged by the tsunami... Many coastal flood protective structures were severely damaged during
the tsunami. For example, concrete armor units weighing 4 metric tons were moved hundreds of feet inland near the area of maximum run-up. In addition, many levees and seawalls were overtopped and damaged. These protective structures were designed for storm waves and were unable to accommodate the waves produced by the tsunami.

It fell down into the sea in about 10 seconds, generating a small tsunami in the bay between Point Nere and Point Luccia. This part of the island is completely uninhabited. A fisherman in a nearby boat observed the event. The positive leading wave came from Point Rioa and propagated throughout the bay. A second fisherman, who was near Point Luccia, also noticed the wave.<P>A wave of about 5.5 meters height was seen in the Porto di Levante and presumably even at Monterosa, Lipari Island. The seismometer network of the Aeolian Islands recorded the landslide vibrations. The landslide mass was estimated through models of the terrain inferred from photogrammetric campaigns carried out in 1981 and 1991. (reference #1315)
<P>On April 20 1988 a landslide of approximately 200,000 cubic meter occurred on NE flank of volcano La Fossa on the island of Vulcano. The volcanic activity of the cone of La Fossa increased in 1987-1988 starting in June 1987, with measured ground deformations and with a seismic swarm on 9-14 August 1988. The direct cause of the slide is difficult to ascertain: the simplest hypothesis is that the mass was pushed to a critical stability point by seismic vibrations associated with the earthquake sequence affecting the region surrounding Vulcano from March to June 1988. Some other causes can be invoked, such as hot fluid circulation in the hydrothermal system (Tinti r533).
The landslide entered the sea generating a tsunami. Instrumental data do not exist since no tide gauges were present in the area, but the tsunami was clearly observed especially in the harbour of Porto di Levante.
Observational data are from eyewitnesses (Tinti r533).
A fisherman, who at the time of the landslide, was in his boat just inside the generation area, reports that at about 5:30 am local time he heard a big noise and, looking at the coast, he had the impression that the mountain was running towards him. A positive wave was excited that raised the boat without damaging it. The water wave was approximately 1-2  m high. Then he felt the boat go down, and other smaller oscillations followed the fist wave. Another boat in the same bay but further from the source, was impacted by the tsunami with no damage.
In the harbour of Porto di Levante many people observed sudden waves entering the harbour, similar to those produced in the sea by a storm, but the weather was fine with no wind. Wave amplitude was estimated to be approximately 0.5 m.
Information (not from eyewitnesses) about observed waves as 0.5m amplitude in some places on Lipari island are reported.  Tsunami intensity 2. (reference #4139)",0.0,100.19400467689137,Catania,585877,0.343

A MW 7.5 earthquake in the Marianas Trench near Saipan produced an observable tsunami at the Tinian dock but no damage. The Civil Defense survey did not find evidence of a tsunami at Saipan, and considered news reports of three to four meter waves at Saipan and Tinian to be greatly exaggerated. However, crewmen of the Jungle Boat on the Talofofo River, Ted,
Andy and Lauren Fairfield told Paul Hattori that they were at the loading area at about 8:00 A.M. when they saw a
rush of foamy sea water coming under the bridge to the loading raft going up the river. The raft rose 5 to 6 feet. The water receded to the bay after 15 minutes or longer and took the form of a strong rip current. As in 1993, debris was carried up the river for a distance of two miles. Talofofo bay is shaped to focus the water to the river mouth at the head of the bay giving a higher water level there. However, there must have been observable waves elsewhere on the northern and western coasts but this area is lightly developed and no known surveys were taken. The tsunami was not reported as having been recorded in Guam and the marigrams have not yet been located. It was recorded in Japan with heights of 26 cm at Hachi, 24 cm at Murotomisaki, 23 cm at Chichijima, 22 cm at Tosashimizu, 19 cm at Yaene, 16 cm at Mera, 15 cm at Kushimoto, 10 cm at Aburatsu, 7 cm at Owase, 6 cm at Choshi, and 4 cm at

<P>The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) has been routinely operating two Permanent Ocean Bottom Seismograph Systems (OBS). One was developed and installed off Cape Omaezaki in 1978 by the Meteorological Research Institute. The other was deployed by the Headquarters of JMA in 1986 off the Boso Peninsula, Kanto District. The OBS off Cape Omaezaki has four seismographs and one pressure gauge for detecting tsunamis, and another system has four seismographs and three pressure gauges. The OBS system of JMA has a long cable for transmitting signals to the station on land. On April 5,1990, another small tsunami was generated by an earthquake of Ms 7.5 near the Mariana Islands, and it was observed at many stations in Japan. We can find in the records of the OBS tsunami-meter not only sea level changes, such as tide and tsunami, but also thermally induced fluctuations and pressure variations caused by ground motion. Traces at TK1 and BSl show the ocean tide fairly well, however the ones at BS2 and Bs3 are surely deformed by thermally induced effects. Another type of thermal noise appears around eight o'clock and continued for about two hours on the records of TK1. Ground motion noise begins at the same time as the earthquake at
6:13 on April 6, JST (9 hours ahead to Greenwich Mean Time) and continues for about two hours. This noise is larger, as the water is deeper. Tsunami waves can be seen for several hours from about ten o'clock, however the amplitudes in the deep sea are much smaller than sea level fluctuations at
the tide stations. (reference #312)",1.0,2384.779485802148,Shizuoka,2922320,0.789

<P>In barangay Santa Fe, Caraga, the residents saw the sea retreat by about 50 meters offshore.  This was followed by the onrush of waves which carried them for about two minutes. The impact of the onrushing wave was so strong that it uprooted a shallow, 4-m tall coconut palm tree standing along the shore. Six fishermen each aboard their fishing boats were washed ashore. Meanwhile, several boats located along the coast were destroyed by the oncoming giant waves.  In sitio Bunga of the town of Manay, 12 stilt houses were destroyed by a 5-meter high tsunami near the shoreline. The residents recounted that they observed a series of at least three tsunami waves (the third being the tallest) coming in quick succession in less than a minute of time interval. Based on the extent of dead vegetation and sand distribution in the sloping parts of the area, the estimated height could have been 3-5 m. (reference #10958)
<P>1992, May 17. Recent field investigations showed that
tsunami intensity generally decreases southwards and northwards relative to Bunga and Zaragoza areas. There was an unusually high tsunami wave height (~6m) at Bunga that
was most probably due to local site effect. Tsunami waves were generally preceded by the lowering of sea water level while the tsunami arrival times have some variation particularly in Bobon and Panompon. The period of the tsunami wave was quite difficult to determine because of sketchy details and so much variation in terms of the number of waves that attacked the areas investigated.
In terms of regional and local geomorphological effects, the 1992 event caused very minor changes. Tsunami sediments were dumped in very few places. It was noted that the coral reefs located between 100-250m from the shore of eastern Mindanao were the coastal features that most probably attenuate the effects tsunami. Local subsidence was likewise observed west of the affected areas.

The only historical tsunami is associated with the 12 March 1993, MW 6.4 earthquake that caused &#8764;0.5 m uplift of the reef along the southern coast of Futuna (Regnier, 1994). A small tsunami was reported along Futuna's south coast but no further observations of the wave were noted (Monzier et al., 1993; Capecchi, 1995). Immediate post-1993 earthquake studies focused on the extensive damage caused by the event including the destruction of every church greater than 100 years old. An earlier earthquake in 1840, with strong ground shaking and intense building damage, was described by the missionary station of St Pierre Chanel, but no tsunami was noted. In addition to historical records, some oral traditions provide tantalising evidence of prehistoric events that may have been catastrophic tsunamis, but age estimates are unclear (Di Piazza and Frimigacci, 1991). While sparse, the data discussed above indicate that the tsunami hazard is real, and the risk for the population who live almost exclusively along the low-lying coast is high. (reference #6956)
<P>The shock was followed by a small tidal wave, localized at  Leava Bay, which caused extensive damage on boats who were there. On this subject, it is noted the authorities broadcasted by radio shortly after the start of the crisis, a message advising people to climb the mountain following the strong earthquake. The Futunians have fully complied with this instruction, fleeing the high part of the island after the earthquake of 13 March (the message being broadcast only Futunan, Europeans were generally not in present and therefore do not respond ...). Although in this case no significant tidal wave happened this evacuation along the coastal plain is be considered still valid in the event of strong shaking (it is not needed to stay more than 1 or 2 hours in the mountains, the tidal wave, in this case, having a local origin and thus occurring a few minutes after the earthquake).

Lobster boats spun like tops. Large lobster cars flipped over or started to drift out to sea... At around noon Tuesday, fishermen in Corea noticed unusual weather conditions: Tides seemed abnormally high, winds pounded the area, and daylight seemed to dim, then brighten again. They had just experienced what Raymond Dunbar Jr. defined as a ""bore tide"" -- a 5- to 6-foot-high wall of water. Dunbar, who was watching the storm... said he saw the tide's effect on Bruce Crowley's boat. ""It had horsed up around another one,"" he said. He saw the boat disappear. ""By that time the tide had bore out again, and she (Crowley's boat) went down out of sight and it made me think more that she had parted her mooring."" Dwight Rodgers, manager of the Corea Co-op, said Wednesday that the tidal action was spectacular. ""There was a lot of water in the harbor and, as if somebody opened a drain, the water just disappeared,"" he said. The tidal bore created a whirlpool effect that caused some of the nearly 30 boats moored in the harbor to whip around each other. Harvey Crowley... could not believe what he saw. ""Boats were all snarled up, lobster cars were out in the middle of the harbor upside down,"" he said...  The tidal action caused one lobster car filled with lobsters to drag its two moorings. A 22-by-14-foot lobster car belonging to Dunbar's son flipped over...  Lobsterman Bruce Crowley said he noticed a difference in the tide as he watched it from his home near Corea Harbor. ""I saw the water all go out, just for a minute. It was up one minute and it was gone the next. It went fast,"" he said. Dunbar said he watched as Bruce Crowley's lobster car broke loose, headed out to sea, and then was pushed back into the harbor by a large wave. ""When that lobster car came in the second time, you couldn't row a dinghy fast enough to keep up with it. That was how fast it came up with the tide. ... It was scary,"" he said. Babe Crowley, whose home overlooks the harbor, said the tidal surge was unlike anything he had seen in his 63 years. He estimated that the wind gusted to about 80 miles per hour... (reference #9221)
<P>Geologist explains tidal phenomenon at Corea Harbor, Bangor Daily News, January 7, 1994. Joe Kelley, director of marine geology for the Maine Geological Survey, who is based at the University of Maine, said... ""What was described in that article certainly was unusual for any area. To have water leave a harbor suddenly and then come back in suddenly as a large wave is not usual. It takes a lot of force to move water, and while there was a storm going on, that probably wasn't all of it,""... Kelley said he had ruled out several causes. He said the event was not a tidal bore because the tides were not right. He also ruled out the possibility that the event was a tsunami... Tsunamis are related to earthquakes and a call to the Weston Geophysical Observatory in Weston, Mass., Kelley said, revealed there had been no earthquake in the North Atlantic area. The U.S. Weather Service, Kelley said, had reported that just before noon, the atmospheric pressure in Providence, R.I. dropped severely... The geologist said he believed the disturbance at Corea Harbor may have been caused by methane gas escaping from the ocean's mud bottom. He said that several years ago he had explored several methane-related holes in the sea floor in Belfast Bay [Maine]... ""What I think happened is a sudden change in the pressure raises the water level that loads the ocean floor, squeezes a bubble of (methane) gas which pushes water out and causes a wave to come into the harbor. The bubble breaks, and the water rushes back out to fill the void,"" he said. Kelly said the event apparently repeated itself several times.

<P>At 7:10 p.m. on November 3, 1994, a large tsunami generated by a massive landslide in the submerged Skagway River delta occurred near Skagway, Alaska, resulting in one fatality and damaging or destroying many harbor structures. At first, it was theorized by some that construction activity in the harbor caused the initial landslide. However, this paper presents the findings of an in-depth scientific investigation that concludes that such a theory is impossible. The findings paint a clear picture of the failure of the submerged Skagway River delta that was overloaded by flood sediments and exacerbated by river diking. Slide volumes estimated at over 20,000,000 cubic yards that consisted of a massive initial slide and subsequent retrogressive earth slides produced the tsunami that caused the fatality and destroyed or damaged harbor structures. 
<P><blockquote><i>Reference #1315:</i></blockquote>
<P>A negative tide of 1.2 m at 7:10 pm local time was the probable cause of a submarine landslide-generated tsunami that caused about $25 million damage and one fatality in Skagway Harbor, Alaska. It produced a tsunami of nine to eleven meters. Because the event was not associated with an earthquake, there was about a year delay before the tsunami community became aware of the event.
<P><blockquote><i>Reference #234:</i></blockquote>
<P>The landslide was accompanied by a series of large-amplitude, high frequency sea level oscillations estimated by eyewitnesses to be 5-6 m in height in the inlet and 9-11 m at the shoreline.

<P>On November 3, 1994, at about 7:10 p.m., a tsunami wave with a period of about 3 minutes and maximum height of 25 to 30 feet occurred in the Taiya Inlet at Skagway, Alaska as reported by Lander(1). The event occurred at the time of a low tide of 4 feet below lower low level. The tidal range at Skagway is about 25 feet.
<P><blockquote><i>Reference #12143:</i></blockquote>
<P>This report by an eyewitness, remote from the work site, confirms two things: 1) the drawdown (trough), not a crest, occurred first in upper Taiya Inlet; and 2) a change in air mass movement (wind) occurred before the drawdown reached the small boat harbor. 
<P>The ""wall of water"" which came northward toward the end of the old north dock, appeared to come over the tops of the tail wall sheet piles as they disappeared, hence a slide at the construction site could not have caused the ""wall of water.""

All of the straw houses were destroyed, and most of the brick buildings were severely damaged. The second wave was the largest and penetrated 300 meters inland. Palm trees
between the village and the sea helped to mitigate the wave damage although most were uprooted. The maximum runup height was 9.5 meters. The wave advanced up the river causing lateral flooding. One boat was carried 60 meters inland.
<P>Lampon, the most eastern of the villages surveyed, had a population of 700 inhabitants before the tsunami. There were 35 fatalities and 40 straw houses destroyed some of which were 500 meters inland. The wave destroyed houses 500 meters inland.

<P>June 15, 1995. A magnitude 6.3 Ms (USGS) earthquake occurred at 00:15 UT in Greece near the Gulf of Corinth. It generated a tsunami that arrived at Eratini immediately after the earthquake. It had a runup height of 0.4-0.5 meters after a withdrawal of one meter a few minutes after the earthquake for a wave height (range) of 1.5 meters. (reference #1315)
<P>On 15 June 1995, 00:16 GMT, a strong (Ms=6.0) earthquake ruptured the western side of the Corinthos Gulf. The earthquake caused extensive damage in several towns and villages along both coastlines of the Gulf, the northern and the southern ones. The maximum intensity (VII+) was felt in the city of Aegion, southern coastline, where the collapse of two multi-storied buildings caused a death toll of 26. Extensive coastal ground breaks and subsequent ground submergence were reported in both coastlines. In the northern coastline, a local tsunami wave was officially reported from the town of Eratini (peak-to-trough 1.5 m) being located in the epicentral area. The wave was observed immediately after the earthquake occurrence. Its maximum vertical run-up was of about 004-0.5 m, while a water withdrawal of about 1 m occurred a few minutes after the earthquake. The water disturbance lasted for about 12 hours. Damage was not reported. Judging from that no tsunami was reported from other coastal places of the epicentral or more remote areas it is tentatively concluded that the wave could be attributed to the reported massive sliding in the sea of unconsolidated sediments accumulated at the local river mouth. A similar mechanism of tsunamigenesis at the same place was considered in association with the earthquake (Ms=6.3) of 6 July 1965. Tsunami generation from either seismic or aseismic sliding of coastal or submarine sediment masses is rather frequent in the Greek Archipelago, including the Gulf of Corinthos. (reference #2278)

<P>The far eastern island of Sakhalin in the Russian Federation was hit by a devastating earthquake of surface wave magnitude 7.6 during the early morning hours of May 27, 1995 when most of the residents of the town of Neftegorsk were sound asleep. Following intensive rescue efforts by local officials and other authorities from the Federation, numerous survivors were found, however, over 1,500 people lost their lives from this earthquake that reduced apartment buildings in Neftegorsk to heaps of
rubble. The town of Neftegorsk, before the earthquake, had a
population of 2,997. According to a preliminary report filed in early June by Alexei Ivashchenko and Victor Kaistrenko, two Federation scientific investigation teams comprised of the Seismological Party and Institute of Marine Geology and Geophysics are at the earthquake
region collecting macroseismic data and traces of possible
small tsunami. One group reported that a small but not distinct tsunami due to this event occurred on the Okhotsk Sea coast near the settlements of Sabo and Val according to information from fishermen that were on the coast the night of the event. They  reported that near Sabo ""ice on the Okhotsk sea started to go to the coast after the earthquake"", and, near Val, ""water waves came to the river mouth after the earthquake."" Another report stated there was small wave action of about 20 cm near the mouth of the Sabo River in the Piltun Gulf. Preliminary information from the nearest tide gauge at Nogliki (about 150 km to the south from Neftegorsk) indicates no tsunami was recorded.

The initial observation from an over flight at 15:40 LT showed that the ice cover of the lake had melted and a phreatomagmatic eruption was in progress from a vent off the northern shore of the lake in a water depth of 40-50 m. Explosions occurred every 4 to 12 minutes. Six explosions were observed with an average interval of 6 minutes between them. Between explosions the lake water displayed intensive bubbling and steaming. The strongest explosions produced a rapidly rising, smooth-surfaced bulb-like mass of expanding gas and pyroclastics. This bulb grew to a height of 450 m, and then it began to collapse as jets of black pyroclastics mixed with steam pierced the shell. A light gray ""collar"" appeared around the center of the explosion about 130 m high. This collar propagated radialy about 20 to 40 m/s to form a tsunami. Meanwhile the pyroclastic jets reached their maximum height of 1 km and collapsed back into the lake to produce a base surge. The interaction between the base surge and the lake water contributed to the formation of complex waves.

The steep northern shore of the lake was violently eroded by the tsunamis and surges, with all plants and soil less than 1.5 m thick stripped off, and poorly consolidated bedrock exposed. Along the rest of the shoreline, more than 1.3 km from the crater, the tsunamis carved new cliffs two to three
meters high, eroded the layer of frozen soil up to 50 cm thick, and removed the vegetation. The tsunamis deposited several discontinuous, finely laminated layers of sand and gravel up to 35 cm thick, with scattered pebbles, and fragments of plants.

A magnitude Ms 7.1 earthquake occurred near the northwest coast of Papua New Guinea 850 km northwest of Port Moresby, the capitol of Papua New Guinea (PNG). The earthquake, which occurred at 6:49 P.M. local time, was followed by a series of three catastrophic tsunami waves that devastated the villages of Sissano, Warupu, Arop (1 & 2) and Malol on the north coast of PNG killing at least 2,182, injuring 1,000, and displacing more than 10,000.<P>The earthquake was felt widely in PNG coastal communities. In the Aitape region, it was reportedly strong enough to make walking difficult and to knock objects over. The main shock was followed 20 min later by two moderate aftershocks that occurred so close together that they appeared to be a single event.<P>The three waves affected a 40-km length of coastline from the mouth of the Bliri River on the west to the town of Aitape on the east. This length of coastline was home to around 15,000 people before the tsunami. The area is predominantly tropical swamp landa home to tribes that rely on subsistence farming and fishing and live in beach homes made of local materials. This section of coastline was particularly vulnerable because a narrow strip of land separates the ocean from Sissano Lagoon, a lagoon formed by a tsunami in 1907.<P>At many locations along this stretch of coastline the first wave arrived about 20 min. after the main shock (just after the first aftershocks). The trough of the first wave arrived soon after dark accompanied by loud sounds that drew curious tribesmen to the beach where they viewed the exposed sea floor. This was followed by an air blast that reportedly knocked people off their feet and a 7 to 10-meter tsunami crest. At Warupu and the Arop villages the second crest was described as riding on the back of the first and breaking over the villages, sweeping debris over the spit and washing it into the lagoon or 500 m inland from the coast. Trees were uprooted, and mature mangroves were broken off at distances of 1,300 m from the shore. Maximum wave heights reached nearly 15 m along a 20-km stretch of the lagoon area.<P>The villages of Arop and Warupu were entirely destroyed.<i><blockquote>Ref #11882</i></blockquote>In 1998, the official estimate of deaths resulting from the tsunami was just over 2,200. Working back from the names listed on the memorials that were erected a year later, on 17 July 1999, authorities have been able to <B>confirm 1,636 deaths</B> (written communication from Tom Ritchie). The difference between the two figures remains unexplained. A further 1,000 were treated for serious wounds (p.48).
<i><blockquote>Ref #2707</i></blockquote>The death toll of the Aitape tsunami disaster has been confirmed at 2,182 as of 7 August 1998 while over 500 people are still missing.

The population before the disaster was about 6,600 and the casualty reached a third of the population. Especially, over two thirds of the people were dead in Arop and Wrapu. The damage of this tsunami concentrated there. These two villages locate on a sand spit of Sissano Lagoon. Sissano Lagoon is 10 km in length, 3 km in width and 2 to 3 m in depth. It was made by the 1907 earthquake. Because the sand spit is 100 to 200 m in width and 2.5 to 3 m in height houses on this sand spit could be washed out easily by the tsunami. Its building was destroyed and only its foundation remained. The average maximum heights of the tsunami waves they crossed the Sissano sandbar was about 10 m. However, the wave height varies at different points long the sandbar and was as high as 15 m above the sea level at the former site of the Arop village.

<P>Vanuatu consists of an island arc formed by the subduction of the Australian plate under the Pacific plate (Figure 2B). Vanuatu is seismically active, with magnitude 5-6 events common, especially in the Central Basin area bounded by Espiritu Santo and Malakula on the west, and Maewo and Pentecost on the east. A magnitude 6.4 event occurred in the central basin in 1965, followed the next day by a magnitude 7.0 earthquake near Epi. A magnitude 7.0 earthquake also occurred in 1981 south of Malakula. Because of Vanuatus steep topography, landslides commonly accompany earthquakesthese landslides may also occur offshore. Wong and Greene (1988) noted many large submarine landslides in the Central Basin that could have triggered tsunamis. Previous tsunamis occurred in 1875 (Vanuatu), 1961 (south of Efate), and 1965, which saw two tsunamis a day apart (the first in the Central Basin, and the second near Epi) (Wong and Greene, 1988). It is likely that most tsunamis in the region go unreported simply because the population is so spread out, and because small tsunamis might strike only uninhabited coast. Both the Harvard and USGS solutions for the 26 November 1999 earthquake are not located on the plate boundary, but are close to a large reverse fault (Louat and Pelletier, 1989) in the back-arc. The fault is segmented by transverse faults associated with Vanuatus active volcanoes. Because the aftershocks are contained within the area bounded by the Aoba and Ambrym transverse faults (Figure 2B), the Harvard solution for the earthquake seems more likely than the USGS solution (which is located in a different fault segment). The Harvard earthquake rupture mechanism shows the failure plane striking at 20 degrees, with a high angle (62 degrees) dip to the east. This mechanism seems consistent with movement on a splay of the large reverse fault of Louat and Pelletier. The tsunami generated by this earthquake caused damage throughout central Vanuatu (Figure 2C). Eyewitnesses uniformly reported three damaging waves, lead by a leading depression wave, as also occurred during the 1992 Flores, 1994 East Java, 1994 Mindoro and 1996 Irian Jaya tsunamis (Imamura et al., 1996).

It inflicted serious damages to structures built close to the seashore, in particular to the local elementary school. The tsunami was generated by the collapse of a basaltic cliff, located 3 km to the southeast of Omoa, along the coastline.

Each of these canyons exhibits unique and similar head morphologies that suggest collapse structures. These heads all notch the distal edge of the continental shelf in about 100 meters depth of water. They are located
near or over the southwestern margin of the Santa Maria Basin, a major hydrocarbon basin. The EM300 bathymetric images show that all four canyons have detritus lobes that flow down canyon from the heads; these appear to represent evacuated material from beneath the collapsed heads.
Along the downslope margins of the canyons, down-dropped walls and slump material indicate sediment failures occur regularly downslope. These canyons are quite sinuous, and it appears that these bends result from mid-slope canyon wall failure. Authigenic carbonate deposits have been
collected at the heads of some of these canyons. It is speculated that the collapse heads, rilles, depressions and mounds are fluid-induced, possibly by escaping gas and fluids associated with the offshore hydrocarbon-rich Santa Maria Basin. This is possibly a landslide-generated tsunami.

<P>A moderate tsunami followed about 15 minutes after the earthquake. Run up heights on open coast were generally less than 1 m, but reached 1.5 m at Kauk and an estimated 
3-4 m in west-facing bays on the islands, and on the mainland coast immediately east of Boiken.
The higher run-up in the west-facing bays was a funneling effect. In both Victoria Bay and Mushu Bay, the larger of the west-facing bays on Mushu Island, observers saw the water circulate counter clockwise around the perimeter of the bay, and reach maximum height in the eastern extremity of each bay. Logs were washed ashore amongst the houses at Buruwan on Victoria Bay and 50 m of land was inundated. Logs, coral and a moored dinghy were washed ashore in Mushu Bay. The reason for the higher run-up east of Boiken is less clear, but perhaps was due to the funneling of the tsunami between the coast and the islands. Tsunami effects were observed as far east as Murik Lakes; where water washed through the villages at ankle depth. The villages are on a low sand bar. In the west, a repeated rising and falling of the water level in the Aitape River of the order of 1 m above normal water level was observed at 6.45 to 7 am. In Wewak too, there was a fluctuation of the sea level at 6:45-7 am, the water draining out into the bay then returning passively to flood across the road, before subsiding to normal level. The drop in sea level was estimated to be 2 m, and the rise above normal sea level, 1.5-2 m. The fluctuations at 6:45 am appear to have been a second and discrete tsunami event.

In the area of maximum damage from earthquake shaking, between Boiken and the mouth of Hawain River, the tsunami was reported to have had turbulent, violent flow. At Victoria Bay at the eastern end of Kairiru Island, the tsunami was observed to approach from the southwest and swirled along the cost with an anti-clockwise motion depositing large logs and other debris. At these locations and on both northern and southern coasts of Muschu Island houses were swept away by the tsunami.

It generated a tsunami that ""caused severe destruction in the [Stromboli] island, produced some damage in the Aeolian archipelago, and was observed in several coastal places in the south-Tyrrhenian sea"" (Reference #2439).
<P>On 30 December at 1315 and 1322 two landslides suddenly formed along the Sciara del Fuoco. As they traveled down the volcano's flank they produced wet, fine ashfall (less than 0.1 mm in size) on the island's SE side. The first landslide had a volume of about 600,000 m3, the second about 5,000,000 m3, and they both reached the sea. Upon contact with the sea the landslides produced two tsunamis with waves that were several meters high. The tsunamis injured few people, and damaged buildings and boats in the villages of Stromboli and Ginostra. Large waves were reported as far away as the town of Milazzo, on Sicily's N coast, 60 km S of Stromboli... According to several news articles, volcanic activity at Stromboli on 30 December caused a landslide, which entered the sea and generated a tsunami. The articles stated that in the small village of Ginostra, waves injured six people, and damaged homes and boats. Residents and tourists were evacuated to nearby Sicily. (reference #2432)
<P>During the last months of 2002 Stromboli was dominated by an intense explosive activity that lasted till December 28. On that day Stromboli started a new effusive phase that compromised the stability of the Sciara del Fuoco flank leading to the landslides of December 30. It has been ascertained that two different landslides occurred in that day. The first one occurred at 13:15 and it was mainly a submarine one, whereas the second one, occurred 7-8 min later and produced a subaerial scar on the Sciara del Fuoco at a height of 500 m a.s.l., for a volume of about 7-8 million cubic meters. The mass moved by the first landslide was much greater than the sub-aerial one, and bathymetric surveys revealed that the total volume of the material moved by the two slides was about 20 million cubic meters. According to Tinti both landslides produced tsunami waves: the first event was characterized by a first negative sea movement, while the second produced a positive wave. The submarine slide caused a sea level lowering of about 10-15 m at the foot of the Sciara, immediately propagating in both directions, northward towards Piscità and southward towards Ginostra. A destructive tsunami, starting with an initial slow withdrawal, violently invested the northern coasts of  the island with three-four big waves. It has been ascertained that within a few minutes the water invaded Ficogrande beach, and attacked Punta Lena and Scari producing severe damage. The second tsunami was generated around 13:22 by a subaerial mass failure. Only a few people were able to distinguish the arrival of the second tsunami and to recognize the positive leading wave, while most considered it as the continuation of the first. Several field surveys were undertaken soon after the event both in the near and far-field. The strongest tsunami effects were observed at Stromboli. In the beach called Spiaggia Longa (north-eastern coast) the highest value of runup (10.90 m) was measured. At Piscità the buildings located near the shore were seriously damaged.

The large tsunamis arrived at the Pacific side of the coast of Hokkaido and Tohoku about 2-3 hours after the time of the high tide. In general, the tsunami run-up heights were gradually decreased to the east and to the west away from those two places except Mabiro where the large tsunami height about 4 m is locally observed. The tsunamis generated by the 2003 Tokachi-oki earthquake were observed at tide gauges in eastern Hokkaido and the northern Tohoku regions.

<P>The destructive Zemmouri earthquake of 2003 May 21 (Mw 6.8) occurred at 18:44 (GMT) along the coast, 50 km east of the city of Algiers, between the cities of Zemmouri and Boumerdès. This shock, the largest felt in this region since the 1716 event, had the epicenter  located very close to the coast (about 4 km) and the earthquake produced severe damage and more than 2,000 victims. Two main phenomena were associated to the earthquake: shoreline uplift along 50 km and a tsunami, triggered either by the earthquake itself or by a submarine landslide. According to Dr. Yelles, director of the CRAAG center in Algiers, the tsunami waves were generated by a river sediment slide. In fact, the area is well known for a large sediment deposited by a river, a deposit which is highly unstable. Instantaneously with the Zemmouri earthquake, a tsunami was generated along the northern Algerian coasts. No run-up values were reported along the Algerian coasts, indicating that the tsunami waves, if any, were not high enough to inundate beyond original shoreline. 
(reference #4139)
<P>A strong tsunami with sea disturbances observed along the Algerian coast, but with significant damage mainly in the Balearic Islands (Spain) harbours, affected the western Mediterranean following the 2003 Zemmouri earthquake (MW 6.9, Algeria). An average regional uplift of 0.55 m was measured along the shoreline in the epicentral area. Field observations, main shock and aftershocks characteristics are consistent with thrust along a &#8764;55-km-long rupture, trending NESW, dipping SE. The seismotectonic parameters indicate a hypocentre 78 km deep and a possible fault break between 5 and 15 km offshore. Several tide gauges located in the western Mediterranean Coast indicated an average of 0.4 m of sea-level change with a maximum of 2 m in the Balearic Islands.

<P>This was a slow earthquake, meaning that the rupture occurred more slowly and took longer than in a normal earthquake. Slow earthquakes usually occur at very shallow depths and produce greater displacements than normal earthquakes. As a consequence, they are more likely to significantly displace the seabed and generate tsunamis. In addition, the magnitude of slow earthquakes may be underestimated by traditional magnitude calculations because the energy they radiate is deficient in high frequencies due to the slower rupture speed. Further, the strongest energy release of the earthquake may occur minutes after the initial rupture and thus not be captured by the initial magnitude calculation. This event was also called a tsunami earthquake, which is an earthquake that generates a tsunami much larger than expected given the earthquake magnitude. Tsunami earthquakes are often caused by slow earthquakes. According to a ReliefWeb report, on 19 July, Indonesian Vice President Jusuf Kalla announced that the death toll had reached 525 with 273 people missing.

<P>A survey by B.C. Environment Minister Barry Penner of the damage caused by a massive landslide near Chilliwack has found that a powerful wave washed out thousands of trees on the shoreline of Chehalis Lake. Penner said it looked like heavy rain and snow that fell last weekend triggered Monday's rockslide on one of the surrounding mountains.
He said it appeared 600 vertical metres of rock and trees slid down the mountainside, washed into the lake and triggered a giant wave. ""Unbelievable,"" Penner said after his visit to the area on Friday. ""It snapped tall standing cedar trees. Full, mature, strong cedar trees just got uprooted and thrown around like matchsticks."" The wave, which officials estimated was several metres high, demolished trees several metres above the normal waterline, leaving only bare rock ringing the lake. ""Very impressive in terms of the power of nature--beautiful and terrifying at the same time,"" Penner said. A number of campsites along the lake were badly damaged by the wave, but nobody was in the area at the time. Officials are concerned that the thousands of trees washed into the lake could dam up a connecting stream and threaten to cause flooding in a nearby First Nations reserve, Penner said. Officials are also concerned about local fish stocks, Penner said. (reference #3720)",0.0,95.05069125267731,Vancouver,2581079,6.895

was observed on 7 May 2007 on the Bulgarian Black Sea
coast. The maximum wave amplitude was three meters, and
the sea oscillations lasted for several hours. The anomalous
behaviour was seen in many places of the coast of Bulgaria
and was stronger in the north. Several accounts of
eyewitnesses as well as reports of local port authorities
and three tide-gauge recordings are available and have been
collected and analysed. The tsunami could have been
produced by a submarine landslide or by atmospheric
pressure pulses. Here, we explore the former hypothesis,
i.e., the possibility that the tsunami was induced by a
landslide that may have occurred on the shelf margin off
Bulgaria. By making use of numerical modelling we find
that submarine mass movements taking place within a
certain delimited source area off Bulgaria may have
generated tsunamis compatible with the observations... The anomalous behaviour of the sea started around 9:009:30 am (Local Time) on 7 May 2007 and lasted with progressive attenuation for about 5 hours. Direct observations were made mostly in the two biggest towns of the coast - Balchik and Kavarna (about 13000 inhabitants each). The port authorities reported similar effects to the north, near Kaliakra cape and the village of Shabla. Slightly more to the south, the observations were documented by observers at the Varna port and the Galata oil and gas platform. The oscillations were recorded by two sea level analogue mareographs, one in Varna and one in Ahtopol (the southernmost point of the Bulgarian Black Sea coast) operated by NIGiF (Scientific Research for Geodesy and Photogrammetry, Sofia).
<P>The tsunami caused only slight damage in the affected
areas. In Kavarna, a 2530 ton tourist boat was rotated
violently according to his captain and was damaged near the
anchor holes and in some other parts, including the rudder.
Many small fishing boats were cast onto the beach in
Kavarna and Balchik Marinas. Debris was deposited on
the shore. Some large tetrapodes (1.2 tons each) fell into the sea from the breakwater of the Kavarna Harbour.

<P>The earthquake in the Region of Aysen generated landslides between the Island Mentirosa and Ri'o Cuervo, generating a mass of earth that fell into the sea causing waves of great size that affected the coastal sectors and the salmon plants of the fiord of Aysen. Three people were killed and seven are missing. (ref #2684)
<P>The earthquake produced a landslide in the fjord area close to Puerto Chacabuco. The landslide generated 3 waves, the biggest was about 6 meters and affected a local area. A tide gauge recorded only a 0.8 m. variation (10 km away from the landslide). (ref #2686)
<P>On 21 April 2007, an Mw 6.2 earthquake produced an unforeseen chain of events in the Aysen fjord (Chilean Patagonia, 45.5 S). The earthquake triggered hundreds of subaerial landslides along the fjord flanks. Some of the landslides eventually involved a subaqueous component that, in turn, generated a series of displacement wavestsunami- like waves produced by the fast entry of a subaerial landmass into a water bodywithin the fjord. These waves, with run-ups several meters high along the shoreline, caused 10 fatalities. In addition, they severely damaged salmon farms, which constitute the main economic activity in the region, setting free millions of cultivated salmon with still unknown ecological consequences... The combined results from all of these studies show that the large destructive waves were likely generated by the concurrent effects of the entry of subaerial landslides into the water body, the subaqueous destabilization of the fjord flanks linked to coastline retreat, and the sudden generation of the compressional ridges, which implied a vertical displacement of the fjord floor of up to 15 meters. (ref #10839)
<P>April 1 (Ms 5,4) which triggered a small tsunami and caused some minor damages to the salmon farms near the epicentral zone. As a consequence, debris flows and tsunamis caused the death of three people and the disappearance of seven, in addition to severe damages to the salmon industry installations. The main areas affected by the tsunami were Punta Tortuga (one missing person), the mouth of Río Pescado, and Playa Blanca (Fig. 7; three dead and three missing people), the mouth of Rio Cuervo, Punta Camello (Caleta Dagny y Ensenada La Perra, one missing person), Isla Mentirosa, the mouths of Frío and Fernández rivers, Punta Yelcho, Caleta Bluff and Bahia Acantilada. <B>Note: reference #9790 clarifies that deaths were not all at this single location and that two deaths were due to landslides, not tsunami.</B>(ref #9790)
<P>The displaced water masses formed swells estimated between 5 to 10 m in height for Aguas Calientes and probably more than 10 m for Isla Mentirosa, which seems to have been after the first wave. From these, in seconds, waves of tsunami were generated that reached speeds of radial propagation estimated between 360 and 600 km/h. The displaced waters left marks by direct impact of up to 50 m in the northern part of the Isla Mentirosa. The areas most impacted by the tsunami waves are: Punta Tortuga, mouth of Rio Pescado, Playa Blanca, mouth of Rio Cuervo, Punta Camello, Isla Mentirosa, estuary mouths of Frio and Fernandez, Punta Yelcho, Caleta Bluff and Bahia Acantilada.

<P>An undersea earthquake is believed to have triggered a mini-tsunami off the Cape west coast last week, causing noticeable fluctuations in tidal patterns, the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) said yesterday. The earthquake caused a mudslide, which in turn caused the tsunami, said NSRI spokesperson Craig Lambinon. The tidal changes caused damage to some factories in St Helena Bay. You get about five earthquakes around the world every day, so it is not unusual  its just that it came without warning, said Lambinon, adding that the quake was not severe enough to warrant a tsunami warning.

<P>Nov. 4 (Bloomberg)--A series of freak waves that crashed into Boothbay Harbor, Maine, caused $10,000 to $20,000 in damage and left experts and residents puzzling over what caused it.
<P>The first of the waves last week pushed a 4-foot to 12-foot (1.2-meter to 3.6-meter) wall of water into the harbor, said Dave Benner, Boothbay Harbor Emergency Management Agency director, citing witnesses.

At the latitude of the earthquake of September 29, 2009, the Pacific plate moves westward with respect to the interior of the Australia plate at a velocity of about 86 mm/year. The earthquake occurred near the northern end of a 3,000 km long segment of the Pacific/Australia plate boundary that trends north-northeast; farther north of the earthquakes source region, the plate boundary trends northwest and then west. The eastern edge of the broad Australia plate may be viewed as a collection of small plates or microplates that move with respect to each other and with respect to the Pacific plate and the Australia plate interior.
<P>On the basis of currently available location and fault mechanism information, we infer that the September 29 earthquake occurred as a normal fault rupture on or near the outer rise of the subducting Pacific plate.
<P>The broad-scale Australia/Pacific plate boundary is one of the most active earthquake regions in the world. Earthquakes occur on the thrust-fault boundary between the Australia and Pacific plates, within the Pacific plate on both sides of the trench, and within and on the boundaries of the small plates that compose the eastern edge of the overall Australia plate.

The tsunami information bulletin referred to a 68 km deep, Mw = 7.0 Solomon Islands (11 deg S, 161.1 deg E) earthquake that occurred at 09:53 UTC (11 April 2010, 11:53 p.m. Cook Islands time). The tsunami travel time from the Solomon Islands is around 6 h. In the absence of any other tsunami information and a lack of storm activity in the area at the time, it was thought that the wave that inundated the southern coast of Mangaia on the 13 April 2010 might have been related to the Solomon Islands earthquake (Aerenga Matapo, personal communication, September 2010).

recede prior to inundation, although they did not observe
the subsequent runup (Allan Tuara, personal communication,

In the coastal town of Constitucion, firefighters were looking for bodies of people swept away by the tsunami as they camped on Isla Orrego, an island in the mouth of the Maure River that flows through the city. Constitucion suffered perhaps the greatest loss of life in the disaster, in part because many people had come for carnival celebrations and were caught in huge waves that reached the central plaza. ""There were about 200 people in tents who disappeared"" on Isla Orrego, Fire Chief Miguel Reyes told The Associated Press.

(ref. #6810)<P>While the Pacific basin was spared a major tsunami, there was major tsunami damage in Chile. In the coastal city of Talcahuano, where the surge reached nearly 5 m from peak to trough, a bizarre exchange took place: While even larger boats landed in the city centre, entire homes floated out to sea. 'The water swept aside everything that got in its way,' said a resident of the small town of Boyecura. A wall of water swept across the Chilean island of Robinson Crusoe, 670 km off the coast, destroying many buildings and sweeping 5 people out to sea. Eleven others were missing. The Chilean Navy admitted it failed to give adequate tsunami warning to Robinson Crusoe, which lies in the Chilean archipelago of Juan Fernandez. (ref. #6811)<P>Islanders in the Chilean archipelago of Juan Fernandez felt a slight tremor early Saturday, one just like any other of those they hardly take notice of, and they slept on. Over the course of the morning, they saw on television the damage that the massive quake had caused in the city of Concepcion and elsewhere on the southern Chilean mainland. And then officials started waiting for information about a possible tsunami, but it ever came. Instead, as they saw the sea starting to rise, they rushed to switch on the sirens - but it was too late for some. The tsunami killed 5 people on the island, while 14 remained missing a day later, a toll that may have been avoided had the tsunami-detection and warning mechanisms been in order, some say. Upon hearing the sirens, some of the 629 residents of the village of Juan Bautista on Robinson Crusoe Is ran to the hills with no time for salvage. A wall of water - possibly nearly 5 metres high - ravaged everything in its way. Within a few minutes, the scene of the adventures of Scottish sailor Alexander Selkirk - marooned on the island from 1704 to 1708, and immortalized in Daniel Defoe's novel Robinson Crusoe - had been razed to the ground. ""Everything that had been along that three-km stretch just disappeared,"" said Fernando Avaria, the first pilot to fly over the area after the disaster. The cemetery, the churches, sports facilities and the area's only school were reduced to planks of wood and broken glass. The buildings of the local authority simply disappeared. ""It was devastating, really out of a horror film,"" said Margot Salas, a local who toured the area with Chilean state television cameras almost 24 hours after the disaster. As the sea receded, Robinson Crusoe Is faced a new flood - one of despair. Mud covered everything within 3 km of the coast. (ref. #6812)",1.0,79.42180416408209,Concepcion,880722,7.869

<P>Underwater landslide likely cause of 'mild tsunami', 29 June 2011 Last updated at 06:33 ET. BBC News article. A ""mild tsunami"" along the South West coast was probably caused by an underwater landslide, a coastal expert has said. The unusual tidal surge struck the Cornwall, Devon, Dorset and Hampshire coastline on Monday morning. There were reports of rivers changing direction, fish leaping out of water and hair standing on end due to static... Roland Stewart from Millbrook, near Plymouth, said: ""It was quite violent in a way, my dinghy was moving around with the movement of the water and I just wondered what the hell was going on.... within 15 minutes it was all over."".. Dr Davidson, an associate professor in coastal processes, told BBC Spotlight: ""[Surges] are quite rare and it's probably not a tidal phenomenon. ""It's probably more likely to be a tsunami of some kind, obviously it's quite mild. ""It's probably not due to an earthquake, which is the normal source. ""It's probably more likely to be a sub-marine landslide."" According to the Tidal Gauge Anomaly measure, which records the difference between the forecast tide and the actual tide, the anomaly on Monday morning in Newlyn, Cornwall was 0.2m (0.7ft), in Plymouth 0.3m (1ft) and in Portsmouth 0.4m (1.3ft). The MET Office in Exeter said it did not think anything in the weather could have caused the change in the tidal pattern. The British Geological Survey said there was no seismic activity in UK waters over the weekend. (reference #9478)",0.0,109.8125964239719,Bristol,686210,7.768

It has been there since 1740 and now is Greenlands most popular tourist destination thanks to the gorgeous Ilulissat Icefjord (tourism is the towns principal industry). All of which brings us to Jens Muller who is a Greenland native but from another community.
He recently posted a most interesting video of an event that happened on a beautiful, sunny day in Greenland; an event that easily could have cost him and two others their lives. Jens picks it up from there. A tourist from Australia came to my uncle and asked if she could get a ride to the glacier just north of Ilulissat, Greenland, so he asked me if I wanted to be his translator. I am from another town where glaciers are fairy tales, I was as much of a tourist as the Australian tourist, so I decided to join the crew. The beautiful scenery was amazing, but the nature doesn't care about anyone. That day almost became our last day. So it was Jens, his uncle and the Australian tourist in the small boat that drove out to the big glacier that everyone wants to see. The glacier flows at a rate of 65 to 115 feet per day, resulting in around 20 billion tons of icebergs calving off and passing out of the fjord every year. Icebergs breaking from the glacier are often so large (up to 3,300 feet in height) that they are too tall to float down the fjord and instead lay stuck on the bottom of its shallower areas, sometimes for years, until they are broken up by the force of the glacier and icebergs further up the fjord. As Jens was filming the glacier and the beauty of the surroundings, that is when it happened. A massive portion of the glacier calved off and dropped into the sea; a big enough piece that it generated a huge wave.

<P>On 26 August 2012 at 10:37 p.m. local time (27 August 2012, 0437 UTC), an earthquake with Mw 7.3 (W-phase) occurred off the coast of El Salvador and Nicaragua. The epicenter, as reported by the US Geological Survey (USGS), was located approximately 75 km due south of the El Salvador coastline (Fig. 1). Approximately 50 aftershocks with magnitudes between 5.5 and 4.2 occurred in the vicinity of the main event between 27 August and 11 September 2012. The initial assessment of the earthquake by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) determined that the earthquake was significant due to the strength of the seismic signal and the long-period nature of the initial seismic waves. Within 10 min of the main shock, additional analysis by the PTWC suggested that the earthquake could be characterized as a slow earthquake.
<P>The strongest tsunami effects were experienced along the central section of the San Juan del Gozo Peninsula. At the time of the earthquake (*10:37 p.m.) it was relatively dark with a quarter moon low over the horizon and a moonset near 1 a.m. The earthquake occurred just after high tide when scores of people were present on the beach collecting sea turtle eggs for conservation projects. A worker at one of the hatcheries was in a ramada (a small shed with wooden posts, and walls and roof made from aluminum siding) located on the beach at the crest of the dunes approximately 70 m from the water when the earthquake occurred. This witness came out of the ramada when he heard people crying out and was subsequently caught in the wave and dragged some 90 m inland where he was ultimately suspended in a tree branch at a height of 2.1 m above the ground. This witness reported that there were three tsunami waves and that the flow depth at the ramada was just below the roof (approx. 2.5 m). During the tsunami, the walls of the ramada were torn off of the posts that are deeply embedded in the sand; the posts themselves were not pulled out of the ground, but some were pushed over by the force of the water. Other witnesses related similar stories, and in total there were more than 40 injured people, with three injuries requiring medical attention.",1.0,184.50997207546828,San Salvador,1105766,7.805

It rose out of the sea at a spot located about 350 feet (100 m) from the coast, he said...  A mud volcano is a likely possibility because Gwadar's coastline already has several of the gurgling, steamy cones, both onshore and at sea... And in 1945, the magnitude-8.1 Makran temblor triggered the formation of mud volcanoes offshore of Gwadar, according to a study on mud volcanoes in Pakistan published in 2005. A recent study in the journal Nature Geoscience also suggests the 1945 earthquake released tons of methane from the seafloor...But Geologist Dave Petley, a landslide expert, thinks the island's low, arcuate (or bow) shape  as seen in the few pictures released so far  suggests a rotational landslide, rather than a conical mud volcano.(reference #10751)

(reference #12691)

The estimated 200 million metric tons of rock spilled onto the toe of Tyndall Glacier and into Taan Fjord, in Icy Bay, Alaska. This landslide produced a tsunami that was recorded at two NOS tide gages monitored by the National Tsunami Warning Center (NTWC). (reference #11514)
<P>An approximately 100-m high landslide generated tsunami flooded the coastline of Taan Fiord in SW Alaska on October 17, 2015. Inundation reached 190 m at its highest point, and exceeded 50 m along over 10 km of coastline. Within the area of inundation, several alluvial fans provided both a source and depositional setting for sediment transported by the tsunami, and each fan is blanketed by tens of cm to meters of sediment. During a month of fieldwork in spring and summer of 2016, we sampled and documented these deposits. Where the wave was largest near the tsunami source, the deposit has two distinct layers: A) a basal layer with very poorly sorted sediment ranging from sand to boulders and B) an overlying layer composed of relatively well sorted cobbles and boulders where interstitial spaces are open except at the base of this layer, where they are packed with sand. Flattened vegetation at the base of layer A indicates the lower deposit formed during inrush. Channeling and small fan-like features in layer B suggest it formed during tsunami return flow. Farther towards the mouth of the fjord, where the tsunami was only a fraction of the initial height, two fans preserve a similar poorly sorted basal layer that was in many places overlain with boulders and/or sand. The thickness of the deposit and its consistency across multiple fans along the fjord suggest both that similar deposits could be indicators of paleo landslide-generated tsunamis, and that deposit stratigraphy from these kinds of events may record useful information about a tsunamis size and character. (reference #11717)
<P>On 17 October 2015, an estimated 60 × 106m3 rockmass (Haeussler et al., 2017; Higman et al., submitted for publication) detached from as high as ~850 m above sea level at the terminus of Tyndall Glacier (Figs. 1, 3), a site of previous landsliding (Meigs et al., 2006). Approximately 90% of the mass entered directly into the fjord, creating a tsunami with runup of up to 192 m (Higman et al., submitted for publication). Some debris re-emerged from the fjord on the opposite shore of Taan Fiord and on the eastern moraine, where it formed hummocky deposits typical of large landslides. Such re-emergence of debris onto land after travel throughwater has, to our knowledge, not been described before. A small portion of the landslide debris (~3%) slid onto Tyndall Glacier and a larger slide block remained within the source area (~7%). (reference #12007)
<P>Glacial retreat in recent decades has exposed unstable slopes and allowed deep water to extend beneath some of those slopes. Slope failure at the terminus of Tyndall Glacier on 17 October 2015 sent 180 million tons of rock into Taan Fiord, Alaska. The resulting tsunami reached elevations as high as 193m, one of the highest tsunami runups ever documented worldwide. (reference #12261)",0.0,1670.5932533146572,Vancouver,2581079,9.359

<P>On February 19, 2015 at 13:18 Universal time (February 19, 2015 at 00:18 local time), a powerful earthquake occurred offshore Northeast Paama and off north of Lopevi [Figure 12]. The Vanuatu Meteorology and Geohazards Department reported a magnitude of Ms 6.0 for the event and at a shallow depth of 10.0 km. No tsunami advisory or warning was issued for this event since the earthquake magnitude is below the threshold of magnitude 7.5 as per the Vanuatu Meteorology and Geohazards Forecast Section Standard Operating Procedures. Thus, no warning was issued for this event. It is the third known back-arc event that has generated a local tsunami; others being the 1999 Baie Martelli event and the 2012 Southeast Erromango event. A local tsunami struck the northern part of Paama and possibly Lopevi and Southeast Ambrym. Sea water receding c. 8 - 10 minutes after mainshock (eyewitnesses at Cave beach, Liro Nessa). Cobbles rattles (sea water receding) then soon after roaring sound. Most people in the village heard roaring sound. The tsunami event involves 3 waves (eyewitnesses); the first after c. 10-12 minutes after mainshock, the second wave is much bigger than first wave after c. 8-10 minutes after 1st wave and the last wave after c. 10 minutes later. The odd hour and tidal condition has much effect on tsunami impact. The tsunami struck at an abnormally low tide condition thus having huge impact on runups and inundation distances. Some preliminary observations of runup heights and inundation distances were made for coastlines of north and northwest Paama [Figure 13]. Runup heights of up to at least c. 8.0 m (inferred above low tide level at time of tsunami attack) and a maximum inundation distance of c. 150 m (inferred from low water level at time of tsunami attack). In some localities cobbles/boulders and beach sea oaks help protect the coastline. (reference #12086)
<P>Tsunami runup heights, inundation heights and distances are high on the Northwest of the island, from Tavie to Liro Nessa. A tsunami flow depth of up to 2.0 m and a runup height of at least 6.0 m were measured [Figure 8]. Inundation distances of up to 120 m were observed on Northwest Paama. The tsunami struck at a time of abnormally very low tide conditions; lowest tide for the month of February 2015. (reference 12087)",1.0,1980.296712175722,Brisbane,2406182,11.714

<P>There is not certainty if the April 16th tsunami was triggered by a massive submarine landslide or seafloor coseimic deformation. According to Oceanographic Institute of the Navy, INOCAR, the crest of the tsunami wave arrived to the city of Esmeraldas 6 minutes after the earthquake. This is a very short time for the tsunami travel time from the tsunami landslides scars proposed by Ratzov et al, 2007, and also for the fault plane for the similar 1942 earthquake, as it is demonstrated in Ioualalen et al, 2011. Using both numerical simulation, the tsunami would have arrived more than 20 minutes from its generation zones. For the case of seismically-induced tsunami, we would need to update the numerical simulation when the focal mechanism is well defined.
<P>Several people at the coastal communities reported remarkable changes in the seawater level and also
strong rift currents, although the amplitude of the tsunami did not reach any high water level.Fortunately for these coastal communities, the tsunami impact occurred at low tide. This important fact appears to be the reason that no inundation occurred and considerable physical effects at the coastalines have been absent. However, this case could have been catastrophic under different tide conditions. It should be noted that some of the authorities were not alerted for a tsunami hazard due to the false perception that a tsunami would not be possible because the epicenter in the continental and not on the marine side.

In Kos, the maximum amplitude of ~1.5 m was observed in the old port of the town, as it comes out from eyewitness accounts, tsunami traces left behind and the analysis of security camera video. In the coast outside the Kos port the tsunami heights did not exceed ~1.0 m. This event occurred in a small area and showed unexpected run-up distribution in the near field area which indicates that the tsunami triggering mechanism is not homogeneous. The event also reminded that the tsunami potential in the eastern Mediterranean is considerable. (reference #11858)",1.0,166.62062603927112,Izmir,2992953,9.599

<P>A second body was pulled from the coasts of Irans southern port city of Dayyer on Monday evening, while four other victims are still unaccounted for after huge waves cause by a sea tornado known as Seiche- pounded the coastal city on March 19, an official said. Speaking to Tasnim on Tuesday morning, Mohammad Hassan Basti, a deputy to governor of Irans southern province of Bushehr, said the body of an eight-year-old boy was retrieved from the pier of Dayyer on Monday evening. He was the second victim among a total of six people lost in the deadly sea storm and subsequent flooding that hit Dayyer on Sunday, he noted. According to Basti, 22 people have been wounded in the incident, 80 dwellings have been destroyed, urban infrastructure has been damaged, and some 200 boats have been wrecked in the natural disaster. Head of Bushehrs Persian Gulf Oceanography Centre Ehsan Abedi had announced that the reason behind the giant waves and the sea overflow was a natural phenomenon called Seiche, saying it occurs when strong winds push water and cause water levels to drop at one end and rise at the other.

<P>On 19 March 2017, a series of waves from the Persian Gulf inundated significant parts of the Port of Dayyer on the southern coastlines of Iran (Fig. 1), some time between 8:00 and 8:20 AM local time (4:30-4:50 GMT). It resulted in one death and five people missing, and reportedly capsized about 300 boats and caused ~$10 million of damage. According to Iranian state media, water progressed as far as ~1 km in land and video footage recorded by local individuals or seasonal travelers reveals surges of up to  2 m in a relatively calm, cloudy morning, even though a significant thunderstorm had occurred a few hours earlier.

However, in the aftermath of the event, scientists have examined the event more carefully, and have now determined that there was no earthquake. Instead, the landslide was so large that it generated significant seismic energy. Two clues that led scientists to see that there had in fact been no earthquake were the duration and characteristic of the seismic signals. Not only did the seismic waves last for approximately five minutes, but they were monochromatic and slowly increased in amplitude (the highest amplitude waves lasted about 30 seconds). Such traits, according to the IRIS blog, authored by John Clinton (ETH Zurich), Tine Larsen, Trine Dahl-Jensen, Peter Voss (GEUS Copenhagen), and Meredith Nettles (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University) are indicative of complex landslide signals. (ref #11836)
